# Business name : Aston Autos
Project Brief:
We have built the application to meet the needs of the business owner: an e-commerce platform with a java backend.
The main aim of Aston Autos is to allow users to purchase cars easily through use of our website. We strive to produce a website that is both easy to use and visually appealing to our potential customer base. The target audience is people who are looking to purchase brand new and second hand cars for themselves or for someone they want to buy the car for. The website allows for two views the standard one for customers and a special view for admins. The java backend is accessible for employees and admins and focuses on features such as stock level and the ability to add products.
